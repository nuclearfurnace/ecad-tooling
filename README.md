# about this repository
This repository will be primarily used for the development of the SmartStand, so things are geared around my working style, my choices in attribute names, my choice of Eagle CAD / SolidWorks / CircuitWorks, etc.  Hopefully, others can still find this useful, but otherwise, it's just a version-controlled place for me to stick these things. :)
